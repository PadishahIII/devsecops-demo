## 2026-08-17 — Semgrep demo vulnerability seed

- Context: The Jenkinsfile already runs Semgrep with `p/security-audit` and `security/semgrep`, while `docs/DESIGN.md` calls for a reproducible SQL injection seed.
- Memory: Keep the normal `/search` path parameterized. Expose the deliberate SQL injection only through `/demo/unsafe-search`, backed by `db.unsafe_search_notes()`, so Semgrep reports a reachable finding without weakening the normal search behavior.
- Evidence: `app/app.py`, `app/db.py`, `security/semgrep/no-formatted-sql.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, `docs/DESIGN.md`.
- Reuse: Use `/demo/unsafe-search` when demonstrating the Semgrep SQLi finding; do not deploy the demo endpoint in a production environment.
